# Pomodoro App
The app to study with the Pomodoro method

to note
the file alert.mp3 should stay in the same directory as the .py file otherwise it doesn't make any sound
I didn't add any alert.mp3 files for personalization, you can download a file .mp3 and name it alert
or, when it's launched, option 5 lets you modify which .mp3 use
